# REST API (Phase 8A)

> **Phase 8A deliverable.** Exposes the evaluation engine over HTTP via FastAPI.
> All routes are versioned under `/api/v1`; OpenAPI docs are auto-generated at
> `/docs` and `/redoc`.
>
> **Phase 8B** (the TanStack Start web UI) is deferred to a later phase — this
> API is the complete, stable contract any frontend (or third-party client) can
> build against.

## Run the server

```bash
ai-speech-shadowing serve                       # http://127.0.0.1:8000
ai-speech-shadowing serve --port 8000 --reload  # dev mode
```

Programmatically:

```python
import uvicorn
from ai_speech_shadowing.api.app import create_app

uvicorn.run(create_app(), host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

CORS is enabled for `localhost:3000` / `localhost:5173` (frontend dev servers).

## Interactive demo

A single-page, dependency-free demo is served at **`GET /`** (not under
`/api/v1` — it's a page, not an API resource). It showcases every feature with
vanilla JS: mic **record-to-WAV** (Web Audio API + in-browser PCM encode) or
`.wav` upload, **reference** generation + list/playback, **full and quick
evaluation**, **colour-coded phoneme diff**, score cards, feedback, and
**history** browsing — all against the live `/api/v1/*` endpoints.

```bash
ai-speech-shadowing serve   # then open http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

Source: [`src/ai_speech_shadowing/api/demo.html`](../src/ai_speech_shadowing/api/demo.html).
The full TanStack Start SPA is deferred to Phase 10.

## Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/health` | Service & model load status |
| `POST` | `/evaluate` | Evaluate user audio against a pre-generated reference |
| `POST` | `/evaluate/quick` | Evaluate against a TTS reference generated on-the-fly |
| `POST` | `/references` | Generate a TTS reference from text |
| `GET` | `/references` | List all references |
| `GET` | `/references/{slug}` | Reference metadata |
| `GET` | `/references/{slug}/audio` | Stream the reference WAV |
| `DELETE` | `/references/{slug}` | Delete a reference |
| `GET` | `/history` | Paginated past evaluations (`?limit=&offset=&sort=`) |
| `GET` | `/history/{id}` | Full evaluation detail |
| `GET` | `/history/stats` | Aggregated progress statistics (`?period_days=30`) |

### Health

```bash
curl localhost:8000/api/v1/health
```
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "models": {
    "wav2vec2": {"loaded": false, "load_time_ms": null},
    "tts":      {"loaded": false, "load_time_ms": null}
  }
}
```

Models load lazily on first use; after the first `/evaluate`, both report
`loaded: true` with their measured load times.

### Generate a reference

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/references \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text": "The quick brown fox", "language": "en", "speaker": "default"}'
```
```json
{
  "id": "the-quick-brown-fox",
  "text": "The quick brown fox",
  "language": "en-us",
  "speaker": "af_heart",
  "duration_seconds": 2.41,
  "audio_url": "/api/v1/references/the-quick-brown-fox/audio",
  "created_at": "2026-06-22T..."
}
```

`speaker: "default"` is the API sentinel — it resolves to the configured Kokoro
voice (`af_heart`). Any other value is passed straight to Kokoro
(`am_adam`, `jf_alpha`, …). `language` is ISO-ish (`en`, `ja`, `zh`, …) and is
mapped to Kokoro's internal single-letter codes.

### Evaluate

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/evaluate \
  -F 'audio=@user.wav' \
  -F 'reference_id=the-quick-brown-fox'
```

`/evaluate/quick` skips the pre-generated reference — send `text` + `audio` and
the server synthesises the reference on the fly:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/evaluate/quick \
  -F 'audio=@user.wav' -F 'text=Hello world' -F 'language=en'
```

Response (`EvaluationResponse`):

```json
{
  "id": "eval_a1b2c3d4",
  "created_at": "2026-06-22T...",
  "reference_id": "hello-world",
  "scores": {
    "pronunciation": {"phoneme_error_rate": 0.12, "score": 88, "grade": "good"},
    "intonation":    {"pitch_range_ratio": 0.68, "monotone": false, "score": 62, "grade": "fair"},
    "fluency":       {"dtw_normalized_distance": 0.05, "syllable_rate": 3.2, "pause_count": 1, "score": 81, "grade": "good"},
    "composite":     {"score": 77, "grade": "fair"}
  },
  "phoneme_diff": [
    {"type": "match", "phoneme": "h"},
    {"type": "sub",   "expected": "l", "actual": "ɹ"}
  ],
  "reference_phoneme_source": "kokoro-g2p",
  "feedback": ["Phoneme /l/ was substituted with /ɹ/ — focus on tongue placement."]
}
```

`reference_phoneme_source` records the provenance of the reference phoneme
sequence used for scoring:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `"kokoro-g2p"` | The reference was synthesized by Kokoro; the target phonemes were captured from Kokoro's G2P at synthesis time and read from `metadata.json`. This is the canonical-target path — the reference side skipped the Wav2Vec2 recognizer entirely. |
| `"transcript-g2p"` | *(Reserved)* misaki G2P run on a user-supplied transcript for an uploaded clip. Future feature. |
| `"wav2vec2-acoustic"` | No cached G2P was available (e.g. an uploaded clip without transcript), so the reference audio itself went through the acoustic recognizer. The "Phoneme alignment" view is correspondingly less authoritative in this mode. |

The demo UI uses this field to label the alignment section: `(target)` for G2P
sources, `(recognized)` for the acoustic fallback. See
[`phoneme-extraction.md`](phoneme-extraction.md) for the full rationale.

Every evaluation is persisted to the history store automatically.

### History & stats

```bash
curl 'localhost:8000/api/v1/history?limit=10&offset=0&sort=desc'
curl   localhost:8000/api/v1/history/eval_a1b2c3d4
curl 'localhost:8000/api/v1/history/stats?period_days=30'
```

`/history/stats` returns `total_evaluations`, per-pillar averages, a coarse
`trend` (`improving` / `steady` / `declining` / `insufficient`), the most
frequently mispronounced `weakest_phonemes`, and a `daily_breakdown`.

## Architecture

```
api/
├── app.py            # create_app(): FastAPI factory, CORS, /api/v1 mounting
├── deps.py           # EngineState singleton (lazy extractor + load timing, refs, history)
├── schemas.py        # Pydantic models + report → EvaluationResponse adapter
└── routes/
    ├── health.py
    ├── evaluate.py   # /evaluate, /evaluate/quick (multipart upload)
    ├── reference.py  # CRUD + audio streaming
    └── history.py    # list / detail / stats
```

### Design decisions

- **Lazy models.** The Wav2Vec2 phoneme extractor and the Kokoro pipeline load
  on first request, not at import — so `uvicorn` starts in milliseconds and
  `/health` reports the real `loaded` + `load_time_ms`.
- **One extractor per process.** `EngineState` caches the phoneme extractor, so
  concurrent evaluations reuse it.
- **Sync handlers.** The CPU-bound endpoints (`/evaluate*`, `/references`) are
  plain `def` — FastAPI runs them in its threadpool, so the event loop never
  blocks on inference.
- **`speaker="default"` sentinel.** Keeps the spec's ergonomic default while
  mapping to Kokoro's real voice names.
- **History = JSON files.** No DB; the same store the CLI `report` command and
  the future web UI read from, trivially greppable and inspectable.
- **Versioned prefix.** Everything under `/api/v1` so future breaking changes
  can land under `/api/v2` without disturbing existing clients.

## End-to-end test

[`scripts/test_e2e.py`](../scripts/test_e2e.py) starts a real uvicorn server in
a thread and exercises the full flow over HTTP. To make the comparison
meaningful (not a trivially-identical match), it creates **two near-identical
references** — `"The quick brown fox…"` (reference) vs `"A quick brown fox…"`
(attempt, one word changed) — and feeds B's real Kokoro audio as the user
upload. The result is a high-but-not-perfect score (~90/100) with a non-zero
PER, proving the phoneme diff genuinely fires.

Flow: health → create reference A + B → list → download B's audio as the
attempt → `/evaluate/quick` (A vs B) → `/evaluate` (A vs B) → history list/
detail → stats → delete.

```bash
uv run python scripts/test_e2e.py
```

## Test coverage

- `tests/test_api.py` (fast, `TestClient`): health, references list/get-missing/
  delete-missing, history list/pagination/stats/get-missing, validation (422 on
  missing fields / empty text). The engine state is pointed at `tmp_path`.
- `tests/test_api.py::TestEvaluateFlow` (opt-in slow): `/evaluate/quick` on a
  Kokoro clip → asserts the full response shape, that the reference is now
  listed, history recorded it, stats reflect it, and `/health` flips to loaded.
