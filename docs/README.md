## 🎯 WHAT is it?

`ai-speech-shadowing` is a Python-based developer framework and personal utility designed to automate the **Shadowing Technique** for language learning. Instead of relying on expensive, high-latency cloud APIs, this project provides a completely private, local machine-learning pipeline that acts as an automated speech coach.

The engine breaks down audio analysis into three distinct pillars:

- **Phoneme-Level Alignment:** Maps exactly what you said down to individual mouth movements and sound units.
- **Acoustic Prosody Analysis:** Measures the pitch contours ($F_0$) and cadence of your voice to see if you sound natural or monotone.
- **Temporal Fluency Metrics:** Tracks syllables-per-second, speech velocity, and unnatural pauses.

## 💡 WHY build it? (The Problem vs. The Solution)

### The Problem with Existing Solutions

1. **High Cloud Latency & Cost:** Commercial assessment APIs (e.g., Azure, ELSA) become expensive at scale and require a continuous internet connection, introducing feedback latency that breaks the rhythm of high-speed practice.
2. **The "Text-Only" Deficit:** Standard Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tools like Whisper only tell you *what* word you said, completely missing *how* you said it. If you mispronounce a vowel but the model guesses the word via context, you receive zero corrective feedback.
3. **Acoustic Naivety of Classic DSP:** Standard digital signal processing (DSP) libraries like Librosa can match audio wave physics (volume, speed) but have no inherent concept of linguistics or phonetic structures.

### Our Solution

`ai-speech-shadowing` combines the linguistic intelligence of speech transformers with the precision of acoustic signal processing. By pre-generating your native target clips using high-fidelity native TTS models (like Qwen TTS), you establish a local "Gold Standard" directory. The engine then uses localized machine learning to evaluate your voice attempts directly against those static references in milliseconds.

## 🛠️ HOW does it work? (The Architecture)

The system passes the target reference audio and the user recording through a multi-stage local processing pipeline:

        MIC["User Recording\nfrom Microphone"]

```

### 1. Audio Preprocessing (`librosa`)

Raw audio from a microphone can contain variable lead-in silence or volume variances. The engine utilizes Librosa to:

- Apply top-decibel split thresholds (`librosa.effects.split`) to cleanly strip trailing and leading silence so comparisons are time-fair.
- Force resample all inputs to a rigid 16kHz mono signal, matching the precise input requirements of deep acoustic transformer models.

### 2. Phonetic Sub-System (`transformers` & Wav2Vec2)

To catch minute accent or sound variations (e.g., distinguishing between short and long vowels), the pipeline avoids raw text:

- Both the reference wave and user wave are processed via Meta's **Wav2Vec2-CTC** model fine-tuned on the International Phonetic Alphabet (`espeak-phoneme-id`).
- The raw logits are converted into phonetic sequences. A standard Python sequence-matching algorithm (`difflib.SequenceMatcher` / `difflib.ndiff`) highlights precise phoneme omissions, substitutions, or insertions.

### 3. Prosody & Pitch Contour (`praat-parselmouth`)

To prevent flat or robotic deliveries, the system matches the musicality of speech:

- Using **Parselmouth**, a Python interface for the classic Praat phonetics software, the engine extracts the Fundamental Frequency ($F_0$) over the audio duration.
- It computes the average pitch, maximum pitch spikes, and total active pitch range. If the user's pitch range drops below a calculated percentage of the native target, the script flags a "monotone delivery warning."

### 4. Pacing & Time Realignment (`fastdtw`)

Because a user might speak slower or faster than the native reference without necessarily making an error, standard time-series data fails:

- The system extracts Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) via Librosa to map the acoustic density of the sound.
- It passes these matrices through **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)** using an Euclidean distance metric. This mathematical algorithm stretches and bends the time axis of the user's audio to track exactly how well the phonetic rhythm matches the reference, providing a final numerical score of physical speech similarity.

- [x] Write API integration tests with `httpx` / `TestClient`  *(+ `scripts/test_e2e.py` over real HTTP)*

#### 8B — Single-page Demo (`GET /`) ✅

> **Done** — a self-contained `demo.html` served by the API at `GET /`
> (no build step, vanilla JS). Showcases **every** feature: mic record-to-WAV,
> file upload, reference generation + playback, full + quick evaluation,
> colour-coded phoneme diff, score cards, feedback, and history. The full
> TanStack Start SPA was deferred to [Phase 10](#phase-10--full-web-ui-tanstack-start-).

- [x] Serve a single hardcoded `demo.html` from the FastAPI app
- [x] Microphone recording (Web Audio API → in-browser WAV encode) + `.wav` upload
- [x] Text → TTS reference generation; list + play existing references
- [x] Evaluate (pre-generated reference) + quick-evaluate (text) → instant feedback
- [x] Colour-coded phoneme diff, score cards, feedback list
- [x] Browse past evaluations from history
- [x] Health / model-load status indicator

---

### Phase 9 — Optimization & Polish

- [ ] Profile and optimize model loading time (lazy loading, caching)
- [ ] Benchmark end-to-end latency (target: < 2 seconds per evaluation)
- [ ] Add GPU acceleration support (CUDA / MPS) for transformer inference
- [ ] Implement audio input validation and graceful error handling
- [ ] Add logging with structured log output
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation (API docs, usage guides)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks (ruff, mypy, pytest)

---

### Phase 10 — Full Web UI (TanStack Start)

> **Goal:** The production-grade React SPA (`web/`) for daily practice. Deferred from the
> original Phase 8B; the lightweight `/` demo HTML already showcases every feature.
> Details in `tmp/phase_10_web_ui.md`.

## 🌐 REST API Specification

The FastAPI backend exposes a clean REST API that both the TanStack Start frontend and any third-party client can consume. All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`.

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`

### Key Request / Response Schemas

#### `POST /evaluate` — Core Evaluation

This is the primary endpoint. The frontend records audio, sends it as a file upload along with a reference ID.

**Request** (`multipart/form-data`):

| Field          | Type     | Required | Description                                         |
| -------------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `audio`        | `file`   | ✅       | User audio file (WAV, WebM, MP3)                    |
| `reference_id` | `string` | ✅       | ID of the pre-generated reference to compare against |

**Response** (`EvaluationResponse`):

```json
{
  "id": "eval_a1b2c3d4",
  "created_at": "2026-06-22T16:00:00Z",

    { "type": "match",  "phoneme": "oʊ" }
  ],
  "feedback": [
    "Your pitch range is narrower than the reference. Try exaggerating rising tones.",
    "Phoneme /l/ was substituted with /ɹ/ — focus on tongue placement."
  ]
}
```

#### `POST /evaluate/quick` — Quick Evaluation (No Pre-Generated Reference)

For convenience — send text + audio, and the server generates the TTS reference on-the-fly.

**Request** (`multipart/form-data`):

| Field      | Type     | Required | Description                              |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `audio`    | `file`   | ✅       | User audio file                          |
| `text`     | `string` | ✅       | Target sentence in the target language   |
| `language` | `string` | ❌       | Language code (default: `en`). e.g. `ja`, `zh`, `vi` |

**Response:** Same `EvaluationResponse` schema as above.

#### `POST /references` — Generate TTS Reference

**Request** (`ReferenceCreateRequest`):

```json
{
  "text": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
  "language": "en",

  "audio_url": "/api/v1/references/ref_x9y8z7/audio",
  "created_at": "2026-06-22T15:30:00Z"
}
```

#### `GET /health` — Service Health

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "models": {
    "wav2vec2": { "loaded": true, "load_time_ms": 1200 },
    "tts": { "loaded": true, "load_time_ms": 3400 }
  },
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

#### `GET /history/stats` — Progress Statistics

```json
{
  "period_days": 30,
  "total_evaluations": 142,
  "average_scores": {
    "pronunciation": 76.3,
    "intonation": 64.1,
    "fluency": 71.8,
    "composite": 70.7
  },
  "trend": "improving",
  "weakest_phonemes": ["θ", "ð", "l"],
  "daily_breakdown": [

    { "date": "2026-06-22", "count": 5, "avg_composite": 75 }
  ]
}
```

### API Design Conventions

- **Versioned:** All routes under `/api/v1` for future backward compatibility
- **JSON responses** for all endpoints except audio file downloads
- **Multipart upload** for audio files (supports WAV, WebM, MP3 — auto-converted to 16kHz mono internally)
- **Pydantic models** for strict request/response validation
- **Auto-generated OpenAPI docs** at `/docs` (Swagger UI) and `/redoc`
- **CORS enabled** for `localhost:3000` (TanStack Start dev server)
- **Async handlers** for evaluation endpoints to avoid blocking during ML inference

## 📝 Design Notes & Decisions

### Why local-only?

- **Privacy:** Voice data is deeply personal biometric information. No audio leaves the machine.
- **Latency:** Cloud round-trips add 200–500ms+ per request. Local inference on modern hardware (even CPU) can achieve sub-second evaluation.
- **Cost:** Zero marginal cost per evaluation after initial model download.
- **Offline:** Works on airplanes, in cafes without Wi-Fi, in countries with restricted internet.

### Why Wav2Vec2-CTC over Whisper?

- Whisper is an ASR model optimized for **word-level transcription**. It uses language model context to "guess" words, masking pronunciation errors.
- Wav2Vec2-CTC with phoneme vocabularies operates at the **sub-word acoustic level**. It doesn't guess — it reports exactly what sounds it heard, making it ideal for pronunciation assessment.

### Why pre-generated TTS vs Live Generation?

We use a hybrid approach based on the engine:
- **Kokoro TTS (Live):** Extremely fast and lightweight. Used for on-demand practice where the user types a sentence and immediately wants to shadow it.
- **Qwen / Heavy TTS (Pre-generated):** High-fidelity but computationally expensive. Users can generate these offline, curate the best takes, and organize them into the `data/references/` folder.
- Static reference files enable **reproducible evaluations** — the same reference always produces consistent baselines.

### Why DTW instead of simple time-alignment?

- People naturally speak at different speeds. A direct frame-by-frame comparison would penalize someone who speaks 10% slower even if their pronunciation is perfect.
- DTW mathematically warps the time axis to find the optimal alignment, isolating **rhythm and pacing quality** from simple speed differences.

## 🔮 Future Ideas & Exploration

> These are stretch goals and research directions — not committed to any phase yet.

- [ ] **Multi-language support:** Currently designed for single-language use. Extend model selection per language (EN, JP, ZH, VI, etc.)
- [ ] **Word-level drill mode:** Isolate individual words from a sentence and provide per-word scoring
- [ ] **Spaced repetition integration:** Track weak phonemes over time and surface them for targeted practice (Anki-style)
- [ ] **Real-time streaming evaluation:** Process audio in chunks as the user speaks (requires streaming Wav2Vec2)
- [ ] **Gamification layer:** Streak tracking, daily goals, XP points, level-up animations
- [ ] **Mobile companion app:** React Native / Flutter wrapper for on-the-go practice
- [ ] **Custom voice targets:** Instead of TTS, allow users to import audio from native speakers (podcasts, movies, etc.)
- [ ] **Formant analysis:** Beyond F0, analyze F1/F2/F3 formants for vowel quality assessment
- [ ] **Accent transfer detection:** Identify which L1 accent patterns are bleeding into L2 speech
- [ ] **A/B comparison mode:** Record two attempts and show improvement diff between them
- [ ] **Export to language tutor:** Generate shareable reports for human tutors to review
